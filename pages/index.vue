        We are planning on creating an <i>open-sourced</i> speedrun leaderboard
        system!<br/>
        Currently development is still on-going and won't be anything outward
        facing (yet...)<br/>
        You can also join the
        <a href="https://discord.gg/k7nCKsxmht">Discord</a> in order to keep
        updated with the devel opment status!

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        This project was started with the goal of improving the speedrun
        community as a whole. Ever since the beginning of
        <a href="https://speedrun.com">speedrun.com</a>, people have had many
        complaints and ideas for improvements. Many of the issues stemmed from
        bad user experience (especially leaderboard moderators). This project
        started with the idea that if someone started up a project for a new
        leaderboard site, people would work on it.
        <br/>
        There is an insane amount of coding skill within the speedrunning
        community (case in point: practice hacks, randomizers, wiki sites, etc),
        plenty of people even do these things for their day job. No single
        person has the time to build a whole new website, hence why development
        slowed on speedrun.com before being transferred to
        <a href="https://www.elo.io/">Elo</a>. But the speedrunning community
        has a whole lot of people who wish for something better.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We're subscribing to the ideology of "<i
      >If you build it, they will come</i
      >". We've started a <a href="https://discord.gg/k7nCKsxmht">discord</a>,
        and are building the project from the ground up! Our dream is a
        leaderboard website that fills everyone's needs and listens to the
        community. The goal is that if the game community doesn't want to use
        the board on the actual website, they'll be able to use our API/Database
        backend to make their own websites. Elo has made many changes that the
        speedrunning community isn't happy with. Changing redirects that used to
        link to external boards, adding advertisements that push boards down
        further, and
        <a

        >tons</a
        >
        of others.
        <br/>
        We as a community should not have to put up with these changes, we want
        to build something with scalability and users in mind. Making this
        project open-sourced means that any time someone wants changes to it,
        they will be able to join the project and help make it come to life!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We want to gather as much feedback as possible, everyone in the
        community can do it, whether or not they're tech-savvy. For this reason,
        you're able to send in any feedback (ideas, improvements, etc) via a
        <a href="https://forms.gle/BKkbN2Er8VW1jFTE9">Google Form</a>.
